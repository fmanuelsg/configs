==Personal configurations==

This repository contains configurations of several of the tools that I use, and
that I try to share and have in sync with different machines. Sharing your
configurations (specially your vimrc file) on a public Git repository is quite
common, but I finally dared to do it thanks to a great Vim and Git promoter,
[http://drewneil.com/ Drew Neil], who made a great
[http://vimcasts.org/episodes/synchronizing-plugins-with-git-submodules-and-pathogen/ 
screencast on keeping in sync your Vim configuration with Git and Github].

==Usage notes==

===Set up in a new machine===

Get the files and set the symbolic links:

*git clone git@github.com:suy/configs.git
*git submodule init
*ln -s configs/vimrc .vimrc
*ln -s configs/dotvim .vim
*ln -s configs/bashrc .bashrc
*ln -s configs/screenrc .screenrc
*ln -s configs/inputrc .inputrc

Etc.

===Get updates from the depot===

*git pull
*git submodule update --init --merge

===Update from upstream repositories===

*git submodule foreach git pull


==To do==

I still have much to learn, and there is still too much that isn't exactly like
I want it to be. Lately I've been using Vim a lot, so I have many things to
tweak in my vimrc. Here are some notes for self reference:

* Use syntastic. The plugin is OK, but I need to add the lint tools to my systems.
* Tweak viminfo and swapfile configuration.
* Reorder and reorganize.
