that I try to share and have in sync with different machines. Sharing your
configurations (specially your vimrc file) on a public Git repository is quite
common, but I finally dared to do it thanks to a great Vim and Git promoter,
[http://drewneil.com/ Drew Neil], who made a great
[http://vimcasts.org/episodes/synchronizing-plugins-with-git-submodules-and-pathogen/ 
screencast on keeping in sync your Vim configuration with Git and Github].
